          <b>Psychometric tests</b> are a standard and scientific method used to measure individuals&#39; mental capabilities and behavioural style. Psychometric tests are designed to measure candidates&#39; suitability for a role based on the required personality characteristics and aptitude (or cognitive abilities). They identify the extent to which candidates&#39; personality and cognitive abilities match those required to perform the role. Employers use the information collected from the psychometric test to identify the hidden aspects of candidates that are difficult to extract from a face-to-face interview.</p>

            <h3>Is Depression A Common Occurrence?</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                Depression is a very real and common occurrence in our society today. As our society has become increasingly competitive, stressful and busy, more and more people are struggling to cope with the mounting pressure on their lives. The World Health Organisation estimates that approximately 450 million people throughout the world are affected by mental health problems, with depression as one of the major categories of mental health distress affecting people (Overcome Depression, 2009).
                            </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                Overall, mental health around the world is a significant issue, with the number of people suffering from some form of mental distress growing year by year. The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom (2009) estimates that one in six adults at any one time have 'significant' mental health problems. Another major survey that is frequently quoted puts the figure at one in four, using a wider definition of mental health problems (Mind, 2009).
                            </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                The breakdown below gives an overview of mental health in Britain alone, showing the forms of treatment commonly required:
                            </p>
    <ul >
    <li>
                                    Around 300 people out of 1,000 will experience mental health problems every year in Britain
                                </li>
    <li>
                                    230 of these will visit a GP
                                </li>
    <li>
                                    102 of these will be diagnosed as having a mental health problem
                                </li>
    <li>
                                    24 of these will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service
                                </li>
    <li>
                                    6 will become inpatients in psychiatric hospitals (Mind, 2009; Based on figures from Goldberg, D. &amp; Huxley, P, 1992, Common mental disorders a bio-social model, Routledge.)
                                </li>
    </ul>
    
        <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                According to the National Health Service (NHS, 2009), in the UK, anxiety and depression are the most common mental health problems, and the majority of cases are caused by stress. NHS research shows that approximately 15% of people suffer a bout of severe depression at some point in their lives. This figure is likely to be even higher as many people who suffer from depression do not get help, or are not formally diagnosed with the condition.
                            </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                Despite these high statistics depression should never be considered a normal part of life. Depression is a very serious mental health condition that requires medical treatment and ongoing management. Being able to recognise the symptoms and causes of depression is the key to understanding your depression and seeking the right treatment and management techniques for these negative emotions.
                            </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                As a society, we still have a long way to go in providing effective treatment and support for sufferers of depression. Community education and awareness on mental illness including depression is essential in allowing for the development of appropriate services and support facilities for depression sufferers. Awareness and acceptance of mental health issues in our society will also allow depression sufferers to be more open in recognising their condition, understanding their mental health and seeking help.
                            </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
                                As a sufferer of depression, admitting the problem and seeking help is one of the hardest things to do, however it is the only positive step you can take in gaining control of your life and managing your negative emotions. <strong>Take that step today!</strong></p>

It is therefore important to be able to recognise harmful amounts of stress in your life and identify ways to reduce and manage these negative emotions.These articles provides a comprehensive information resource and tool kit on the negative emotion of stress including strategies and tips for managing stress in everyday life. Information and recommendations provided throughout these articles are drawn from a range of medical professionals and reputable sources.</p>
          <p>Stress affects everyone at some point in their lives. Stress can be caused by a wide range of factors and events and is commonplace in society today. People experience different types and levels of stress in their lives and find different ways of managing their own stress. While a degree of stress in one&rsquo;s live can help motivation and performance, high levels of stress can be harmful. When stress and pressure exceed a person&rsquo;s ability to cope, stress has a significantly negative impact on everyday life. It is important to be able to recognise levels of stress that are potentially harmful to your life and the people around you.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Stress is increasingly becoming an issue in today&rsquo;s society as more and more people are coming under mounting pressures at work, at home and in their social lives. The UK&rsquo;s Health and Safety Executives research showed that in the UK alone, 105 million work days are lost to stress each year (Stress Management Society, 2009). Other significant findings of the research concluded that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>11% of absence at work is attributed to stress</li>
    <li>52% say stress levels are increasing</li>
    <li>60% claim stress is damaging staff retention</li>
    <li>83% think stress is harming productivity (Stress Management Society, 2009)</li>
    </ul>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Anxiety</h2>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Anxiety is a common occurrence in today's society and often this is a reaction to a stressor (e.g. a stressful situation, financial troubles etc).  Anxiety can be more commonly recognised as 'angst' or 'worry' about something, although often the subject is not actually aware what that stressor is, and just generally feels a sense of dread or panic.  In some subjects anxiety can manifest itself in the form of panic attacks.These articles provides a comprehensive information resource and tool kit on the negative emotion of anxiety including strategies and tips for managing anxiety in everyday life. Information and recommendations provided throughout these articles are drawn from a range of medical professionals and reputable sources.</p>

        <h3>Is Anxiety a Common Occurrence?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Everyone at some point in there life experiences Anxiety, and many people may be suffering from anxiety and not even realise it.  In fact it is estimated that approximately 5% of the population may suffer from Anxiety Disorders at any time.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Whilst anxiety is very common in society it is also usually a very much "under the surface" disorder in that sufferers generally suffer in silence or use medications that block the symptoms of anxiety without actually curing the true causes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Interestingly anxiety is most prevalent in women between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age, and they are more than twice as likely to suffer from an anxiety disorder than men.  Most sufferers will never seek treatment despite the fact that the majority of those who do seek treatment are treated successfully.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Anxiety can be caused by numerous things ranging from small to big things (such as a death of someone close, going on a date, school tests, illness etc) and can last a very short period of time stretching to months of even years depending on the personal situation.  However, usually once time has passed or the situation resolved, anxiety tends to pass.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
          Researchers and clinicians are starting to closely examine exactly what makes video games addictive. To date, research on video game addiction has generally found that certain games and game genres are potentially more addictive than others. That is, all video games are not equally likely to result in excessive use. 
          Most research suggests that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like World of Warcraft and first person shooter games (FPS) like Call of Duty tend to be more addictive than other genres like platformers, fighters, racers, and casual games.
          What is becoming clear is that the more addictive games often intertwine well-established psychological principles into gameplay to encourage longer and more frequent gaming sessions. In general, the most addictive video games:
        </p>
        <ul>
    <li>have no end…which means that someone can play forever without "beating" the game and receiving the clear signal that the game is over and it is time to move on</li>
    <li>encourage online social interactions with other players…which often requires great dedication and commitment to a team of fellow gamers to accomplish tasks / goals, even if this means neglecting "real world" responsibilities</li>
    <li>are based on a variable ratio interval reward schedule…which rewards the player after a predetermined average number of in-game responses…and is well-established as the form of reinforcement that is best at keeping a behavior (any behavior) alive even when rewards become less frequent (which is often true of video games)</li>
    <li>frequently reward the player for minimal effort in the early stages of gameplay and then gradually increases the amount of time and effort that is necessary to receive a reward as the game progresses…and by this time the player is already "hooked"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mb-5">What problems are caused by video game addiction?</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Video game addiction obviously does not have the same impact on everyone who experiences it. In general though, the problems associated with unhealthy video game habits can be classified according to the five following categories:</p>
    <h4 class="mb-5">Emotional Problems</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">People struggling with video game addiction may be at a greater risk for depression, loneliness, social anxiety, anger, and feelings of shame or embarrassment for spending so much time playing games. Note that these issues may be the result of video game addiction but may also play roles in the development of excessive play.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-5">Financial Problems</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">This is not typically an issue for children, but adults and adolescents may find themselves spending large sums of money on new computer equipment, consoles, subscription fees, and of course, new video games. Additionally, financial difficulties can occur when the person loses the motivation to work (a frequent occurrence), has his or her hours reduced due to poor job performance, or is fired.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-5">Health Problems</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">People addicted to video games often develop poor sleep habits (due to late night gaming sessions), may neglect personal hygiene, may get very little physical activity, and may make poor choices with regard to eating (e.g., frequent snacking so that gaming can continue rather than having proper meals). Excessive video game play has been linked to childhood obesity.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-5">Social Problems</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">As the addiction worsens, video game addicts tend to spend more time playing and less quality time with friends, family, or significant others. The addict may claim that he or she has "lots of friends online" yet still experience loneliness, depression, and social isolation due to the lack of in-person contact with others.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-5">Family Problems</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Family problems may be the most common difficulty for those who are addicted to video games. Although poor family relationships may increase the likelihood of video game addiction, video game addiction often leads to family conflict. Someone addicted to video games may accuse concerned family members of trying to interfere in his or her life, may be verbally or physically aggressive when others attempt to limit gameplay, and may try to hide just how much he/she plays. Parents with children or teens addicted to video games may disagree about how much of a problem it is or how to intervene. </p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Internet Addiction</h2>
        </div>
          <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
            Internet addiction is described as an impulse control disorder, which does not involve use of an intoxicating drug and is very similar to pathological gambling.  Some Internet users may develop an emotional attachment to on-line friends and activities they create on their computer screens. Internet users may enjoy aspects of the Internet that allow them to meet, socialize, and exchange ideas through the use of chat rooms, social networking websites, or "virtual communities."   Other Internet users spend endless hours researching topics of interest Online or "blogging".  Blogging is a contraction of the term "Web log", in which an individual will post commentaries and keep regular chronicle of events.  It can be viewed as journaling and the entries are primarily textual.Similar to other addictions, those suffering from Internet addiction use the virtual fantasy world to connect with real people through the Internet, as a substitution for real-life human connection, which they are unable to achieve normally.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mb-5">What are the warning signs of Internet addiction?</h4>
          <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
             <ul>
              <li>Preoccupation with the Internet.  (Thoughts about previous on-line activity or anticipation of the next on-line session.)</li>
              <li>Use of the Internet in increasing amounts of time in order to achieve satisfaction.</li>
              <li>Repeated, unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use.</li>
              <li>Feelings of restlessness, moodiness, depression, or irritability when attempting to cut down use of the Internet.</li>
              <li>On-line longer than originally intended.</li>
              <li>Jeopardized or risked loss of significant relationships, job, educational or career opportunities because of Internet use.</li>
              <li>Lies to family members, therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with the Internet.</li>
              <li>Use of the Internet is a way to escape from problems or to relieve a dysphoric mood.  (e.g. Feelings of hopelessness, guilt, anxiety, depression.)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4 class="mb-5">What are the effects?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
              Internet addiction results in personal, family, academic, financial, and occupational problems that are characteristic of other addictions.  Impairments of real life relationships are disrupted as a result of excessive use of the Internet.  Individuals suffering from Internet addiction spend more time in solitary seclusion, spend less time with real people in their lives, and are often viewed as socially awkward. Arguments may result due to the volume of time spent on-line.  Those suffering from Internet addiction may attempt to conceal the amount of time spent on-line, which results in distrust and the disturbance of quality in once stable relationships.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
              Some suffering from Internet addiction may create on-line personas or profiles where they are able to alter their identities and pretend to be someone other than himself or herself.  Those at highest risk for creation of a secret life are those who suffer from low-self esteem feelings of inadequacy, and fear of disapproval.  Such negative self-concepts lead to clinical problems of depression and anxiety.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">
              Many persons who attempt to quit their Internet use experience withdrawal including: anger, depression, relief, mood swings, anxiety, fear, irritability, sadness, loneliness, boredom, restlessness, procrastination, and upset stomach.  Being addicted to the Internet can also cause physical discomfort or medical problems such as: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, dry eyes, backaches, severe headaches, eating irregularities, (such as skipping meals), failure to attend to personal hygiene, and sleep disturbance.
