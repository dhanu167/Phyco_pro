    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Psychometric tests are a standard and scientific method used to measure individuals&#39; mental capabilities and behavioural style. Psychometric tests are designed to measure candidates&#39; suitability for a role based on the required personality characteristics and aptitude (or cognitive abilities). They identify the extent to which candidates&#39; personality and cognitive abilities match those required to perform the role. Employers use the information collected from the psychometric test to identify the hidden aspects of candidates that are difficult to extract from a face-to-face interview.</p><p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Once the Human Resources manager, or person/s in charge of hiring, ascertains that you have fulfilled the initial requirements for the position by reviewing your r&#233;sum&#233; , they will then send out a letter with specific instructions for sitting the psychometric test. The prime objective of this is to identify at an early stage those job applicants who are unlikely to fill the requirements of the position on offer and consequently narrow the applications further. </p><p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align:justify;">Some job applicants believe that the psychometric test is not a good measure to assess their real abilities, personality traits, and suitability for the job. However, the psychometric tests are statistically examined, and are constructed to be objective and unbiased.&#160; This is done by using standard methods of assessment so that everyone is presented with the same questions and instructions for completing them. Our experience shows that psychometric tests are very reliable in predicting candidates&#39; performance, and in most cases the test report provides an accurate evaluation of the applicant. However, this doesn&#39;t say that with a good preparation you can&#39;t improve your suitability for a job.&#160;We&#160; have proven that an effective&#160; preparation which highlights your relevant strengths and improves your weaknesses increases your chances to win the job you wish to get.
